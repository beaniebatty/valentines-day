            To my dearest Sean,<br><br>
            
            I know we probably won't be able to see each other on Valentine's Day but I figured I'd do something even if it's small. Since we became friends seven years ago,
            I haven't met anyone else that I could so confidently say that I see as my soulmate. Through everything we've experienced together you've remained my second half and there's genuinely
            no one else on Earth I'd rather spend my most important moments with. You have no idea how much I wish I could do way more than make this website but I need to show you a tiny bit of what's
            gonna allow me to do more in the future :3. For now, I just wanna let you know how much you mean to me, even though there aren't enough words in any language to express just how important you are to me.
            I hope everything goes your way this month and we find 10k dollars on the ground somewhere so we can have the best sushi dinner ever!!<br><br>

            I love you so so much Binu and even though I know you don't always feel like it, you've never been and never will be a burden on me and there's nothing that makes me prouder than being someone important in your life.<br><br>

            With Love,<br>
            Micah
